# TODO List

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update frontend to skip driver validation when confirming orders
- [x] Modified executeConfirmOrder in OrderDetailsScreen.js to use the same logic as markOrderAsDelivered
- [x] Simplified confirm order to just call executeOrderAction without driver validation

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Test the confirm order functionality with the updated backend
- [ ] Verify that orders can be confirmed without valid driver authentication
- [ ] Update any other screens or components that might have similar driver validation logic

## Notes
- Backend has been updated to allow confirming orders without driver validation
- Frontend now uses the same simple logic as markOrderAsDelivered for confirm order
- Removed all driver validation and profile checks from confirm order flow
