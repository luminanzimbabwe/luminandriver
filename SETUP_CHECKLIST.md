## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Network request failed"
**Solution:**
- Check backend URL is correct
- Verify backend is running
- Check network connectivity
- Verify CORS settings on backend
- Check if using `http://` instead of `https://` (may need cleartext traffic on Android)

### Issue: "Token is invalid"
**Solution:**
- Token may have expired
- User needs to login again
- Check token format in Authorization header
- Verify backend token validation

### Issue: Orders not loading
**Solution:**
- Check if token is valid
- Verify endpoint URL is correct
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify user has assigned orders

### Issue: Location not updating
**Solution:**
- Check location permissions granted
- Verify GPS is enabled on device
- Check if location services are enabled in app settings
- Test on physical device (not simulator)

### Issue: App crashes on order action
**Solution:**
- Check order ID is valid
- Verify endpoint exists on backend
- Check response format matches expected
- Look at error logs for details

## üìù Notes

### Backend Response Format
Ensure your backend returns data in this format:

```json
// Success response
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}

// Error response
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

Or ensure the API service properly transforms responses.

### Order Status Values
Ensure backend uses these status values:
- `pending`
- `confirmed`
- `canceled`
- `delivered`

### Testing Credentials
Keep a set of test credentials handy:
- Test username
- Test password
- Test OTP (if using fixed OTP in dev)
